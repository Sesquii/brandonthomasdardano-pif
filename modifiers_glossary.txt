Modifiers Glossary
-token
Description: Outputs token usage as three numbers (input tokens | output tokens | token ratio).
Example: -token → 45|120|2.67
Behavior Notes: Only outputs numeric token info when included in prompt; no text appended.

-appendmodifier
Description: Controls whether modifier labels appear appended at the end of responses.
Example: -appendmodifier used → modifier labels appear; omitted → no labels appended.
Behavior Notes: Default is no appended labels unless this modifier is included.

-concise
Description: Requests shorter, more compact responses from the model.
Example: -concise → “Short answer.”
Behavior Notes: Overrides default verbosity without needing verbose phrasing.

-explain
Description: Compares text in parentheses with recent outputs, assimilates differences, and generates a simplified explanation.
Example: -explain(syntax trees) → Simplified explanation about syntax trees based on conversation history.
Behavior Notes: Useful for quick clarifications and digesting complex info.

-example<number>(prompt)
Description: Generates the specified number of examples related to the prompt.
Example: -example<3>(prompt engineering) → 3 prompt engineering examples.
Behavior Notes: Focuses on diverse, relevant examples with minimal redundancy.

-brainstorm<number>(concept prompt)
Description: Generates multiple correlated, original idea prompts inspired by prior conversations, prioritizing originality over complexity.
Example: -brainstorm<2>(space) → 2 unique space-related brainstorming prompts.
Behavior Notes: Intended for creative ideation sessions.

-behaviornotes(modifier) / -behaviordetails(modifier)
Description: Outputs detailed behavior notes about the specified modifier on prompt request.
Example: -behaviornotes(-concise) → Explanation of how -concise works.
Behavior Notes: Does NOT appear in the schema file; only on request.

-modifierexample(modifier)
Description: Outputs a single usage example of the specified modifier on prompt request.
Example: -modifierexample(-token) → Shows how to use -token.
Behavior Notes: Example is omitted from the schema file.

-generate
Description: Produces a set of three example types: derived, extrapolated, and inferred.
Example: -generate(prompt engineering) → Generates three varied examples.
Behavior Notes: Automatically combines -deriveexample, -extrapolateexample, and -inferexample.

-deriveexample
Description: Produces an example derived directly from a prompt.
Example: -deriveexample(prompt engineering) → An example closely based on prompt engineering.
Behavior Notes: Focused on clear, direct derivation.

-extrapolateexample
Description: Generates an example that extrapolates or extends the original prompt concept.
Example: -extrapolateexample(prompt engineering) → An extended or futuristic example.
Behavior Notes: Explores ideas beyond the literal prompt.

-inferexample
Description: Creates an inferred example based on implicit understanding of the prompt.
Example: -inferexample(prompt engineering) → Implied or less obvious example.
Behavior Notes: Adds depth through inference.

-abstractexample
Description: Produces a highly generalized or conceptual example.
Example: -abstractexample(prompt engineering) → Abstracted concepts related to prompt engineering.
Behavior Notes: Emphasizes generalization.

-concreteexample
Description: Produces a specific, tangible example.
Example: -concreteexample(prompt engineering) → A detailed, real-world example.
Behavior Notes: Emphasizes specificity.

-surjectiveexample
Description: Generates examples showing many-to-one mappings in concepts.
Example: -surjectiveexample(prompt engineering) → Multiple inputs mapping to a single concept.
Behavior Notes: Explores conceptual mappings.

-injunctiveexample
Description: Provides prescriptive or instructive examples implying action.
Example: -injunctiveexample(prompt engineering) → Instructions or commands related to prompt engineering.
Behavior Notes: Focuses on practical directives.

-interpolateexample
Description: Generates examples interpolating between known examples.
Example: -interpolateexample(prompt engineering) → An example blending multiple known ideas.
Behavior Notes: Connects dots between concepts.

-update
Description: Modifier to trigger an update of the schema file from the model.
Example: -update → Updates modifierschema.md with current definitions.
Behavior Notes: Intended for manual or scripted schema sync.

-updateglossary
Description: Modifier to generate a comprehensive text glossary file of all modifiers.
Example: -updateglossary → Produces latest full glossary for manual upload.
Behavior Notes: Useful for external review or backups.
